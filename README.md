# Talisman

Talisman is a cybernetic practice suite for digital introspection and chaos magic.

It is a "Cybernetic Spirit" forged from three components:
1.  **Aphrodite** (Time)
2.  **Logos** (Intent)
3.  **Kamea** (Geometry)

The **Daemon** is the vessel that binds them.

## Structure

- **Crates**
    - `aphrodite`: Time & Astrology logic.
    - `logos`: Input, Intent, & Hashing logic.
    - `kamea`: Geometry & Grid logic.

- **Apps**
    - `daemon`: The Nannou-based visual engine.
